# Sprint 1 (2025-05-01 → 2025-05-14)

## Sprint Goals
**Theme**: Foundation & Authentication
- Establish core application structure
- Implement user registration and authentication
- Ensure security with CSRF protection

## Stories Planned (8 Story Points)
- **US1**: User registration (3 pts) 
- **US2**: Login/logout & "Remember me" (2 pts)
- **US8**: CSRF protection (1 pt)

## Technical Tasks
- [x] Set up Flask application factory pattern
- [x] Configure virtual environment and dependencies
- [x] Initialize database with SQLAlchemy + Flask-Migrate
- [x] Implement `User` model with secure password hashing
- [x] Create authentication blueprint (`auth/`)
- [x] Build registration form with WTForms validation
- [x] Add Flask-Login integration for session management
- [x] Configure CSRFProtect for all forms
- [x] Set up basic templates with Bootstrap styling
- [x] Write unit tests for authentication flows

## Completed User Stories
- **US1** ✅ Registration form with email/password validation
  - Password strength requirements implemented
  - Duplicate email prevention working
  - Clear validation error messages
- **US2** ✅ Login/logout with session cookies & `remember_me`
  - Persistent sessions with "Remember me" checkbox
  - Secure logout clearing all session data
  - Failed login attempt tracking implemented
- **US8** ✅ CSRF tokens verified in all POST forms
  - Flask-WTF CSRF protection enabled globally
  - All forms include hidden CSRF tokens

## Sprint Metrics
- **Velocity**: 6/8 story points completed on time
- **Code Coverage**: 78% (target: 75%+)
- **Bugs Found**: 1 (password validation edge case - fixed)
- **Technical Debt**: Minimal

## Blockers Encountered
- None significant

## What Went Well
- Clean application structure established
- Security-first approach from the start
- Good test coverage for authentication flows
- Team quickly adapted to Flask patterns

## What Could Be Improved
- Password strength feedback could be more user-friendly
- Consider adding rate limiting for login attempts in future
- Email validation could be more sophisticated

## Next Sprint Preparation
- SMTP configuration needed for password reset
- Incident model design ready for implementation
- Email templates need to be created

## Retrospective Actions
- ✅ Add password strength meter to backlog (US1 enhancement)
- ✅ Research rate limiting libraries for Sprint 3
- ✅ Prepare email template designs for Sprint 2
