# Sprint 3 (2025-05-29 → 2025-06-11)

## Sprint Goals
**Theme**: Data Management & Access Control
- Enable users to view and manage their incidents
- Implement category management for admins
- Establish role-based access control

## Stories Planned (10 Story Points)
- **US5**: Paginated & filterable incident list (2 pts)
- **US6**: Category CRUD (admin only) (3 pts)
- **US7**: Incident edit & delete (roles) (5 pts)

## Technical Tasks
- [x] Integrate Flask-Paginate for incident listing
- [x] Build advanced search and filtering system
- [x] Create category management blueprint
- [x] Implement role-based access decorators
- [x] Add incident edit/delete forms with validation
- [x] Create admin-only navigation elements
- [x] Add bulk operations foundation
- [x] Implement soft delete for incidents
- [x] Add incident status workflow logic

## Completed User Stories
- **US5** ✅ Incident list view with search, filters, pagination
  - Paginated display (10, 25, 50 items per page)
  - Search functionality across title and description
  - Filter by status (Open, In Progress, Closed)
  - Filter by category with multi-select
  - Sort by date, status, category
  - Mobile-responsive data table
  - "No results" state with helpful messaging
- **US6** ✅ Category management UI & routes (admin only)
  - Create new categories with name/description
  - Edit existing categories with validation
  - Delete categories with incident reassignment
  - Admin-only access with role checking
  - Category usage statistics displayed
- **US7** ✅ Incident edit/delete with access control
  - Users can edit their own incidents
  - Admins can edit any incident
  - Soft delete implementation with recovery option
  - Status change workflow (Open → In Progress → Closed)
  - Audit trail for all changes
  - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Sprint Metrics
- **Velocity**: 10/10 story points completed on time
- **Burndown**: Consistent progress throughout sprint
- **Code Coverage**: 85% (↑3% from Sprint 2)
- **Bugs Found**: 3 (CSRF token issue, pagination edge case, role check bypass - all fixed)
- **Performance**: Page load times under 200ms for incident list

## Blockers Encountered
- **CSRF Token Issue**: Delete forms missing CSRF protection
  - **Resolution**: Added `{{ csrf_token() }}` to all delete forms
  - **Impact**: Half day delay, caught in testing

## What Went Well
- Role-based access control implementation was clean
- Pagination and filtering performed well under load
- Admin interface intuitive and user-friendly
- Search functionality exceeded expectations

## What Could Be Improved
- Category reassignment UX could be smoother
- Bulk operations need more comprehensive testing
- Mobile responsiveness needs refinement
- Loading states for AJAX operations

## Technical Debt Identified
- Navigation bar links need dynamic role-based rendering
- Search indexing could be optimized for large datasets
- Category deletion cascade logic needs review
- Status change notifications not yet implemented

## Security Enhancements
- Added `@admin_required` decorator for sensitive operations
- Implemented proper CSRF protection on all forms
- Added input sanitization for search queries
- Role-based template rendering to hide unauthorized actions

## Database Performance
- Added indexes on frequently queried columns
- Optimized category join queries
- Implemented lazy loading for related data
- Query count reduced by 40% through eager loading

## User Experience Improvements
- Added keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Implemented breadcrumb navigation
- Added contextual help tooltips
- Improved form validation feedback

## Next Sprint Preparation
- 2FA implementation research completed
- Audit logging requirements defined
- Dashboard analytics wireframes approved
- Chart.js integration planned

## Retrospective Actions
- ✅ Consolidate navigation template for role-based links
- ✅ Plan bulk operations testing strategy
- ✅ Research advanced search indexing solutions
- ✅ Create mobile UX improvement backlog items
- ⏳ Schedule performance testing for large datasets
