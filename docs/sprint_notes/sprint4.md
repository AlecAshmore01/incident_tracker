  - Admin-only audit log viewer with search and filtering
  - Export functionality for compliance reporting
  - Performance optimized with minimal impact on operations
  - 90-day retention policy implemented
- **US12** ✅ Analytics page showing incident trends
  - Interactive charts showing incidents over time
  - Status distribution pie chart with drill-down

## Sprint Metrics
- **Velocity**: 21/21 story points completed
- **Burndown**: Accelerated delivery in final week
- **Code Coverage**: 88% (↑3% from Sprint 3)
- **Bugs Found**: 4 (2FA timing issue, chart rendering bug, audit query performance, mobile layout - all fixed)
- **Security Score**: 95% (external security audit)

## Blockers Encountered
- **Chart.js CSP Compliance**: Bundle needed relocation for Content Security Policy
  - **Resolution**: Moved Chart.js to `static/js/dashboard.js` with proper CSP headers
  - **Impact**: 1 day delay, resolved with infrastructure team

## What Went Well
- 2FA implementation exceeded security requirements

- Dashboard analytics impressed stakeholders
- Team collaboration on UX/UI was excellent
- Performance optimization successful

## What Could Be Improved
- 2FA setup UX could be more intuitive for non-technical users
- Chart loading states need improvement
- Audit log search could be more powerful
- Mobile dashboard experience needs refinement

## Security Achievements
- Implemented TOTP-based 2FA with industry standards
- Created comprehensive audit trail for compliance
- Added backup code recovery system
- Established secure token management
- Passed external security audit with 95% score

## Performance Optimizations
- Dashboard API endpoints cached for 5 minutes
- Chart data aggregation optimized with database views
- Audit log queries indexed for fast retrieval
- AJAX loading for better perceived performance
- Lazy loading implemented for chart components

## Analytics Insights Delivered
- Incident trend analysis with seasonal patterns
- Category performance metrics for resource allocation
- User activity tracking for workflow optimization
- Resolution time analytics for SLA monitoring
- Export capabilities for stakeholder reporting

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Consolidated navigation rendering (carried over from Sprint 3)
- Improved error handling across all modules
- Standardized API response formats
- Enhanced logging configuration
- Refactored authentication middleware

## User Feedback Integration
- Added contextual help for 2FA setup
- Improved chart tooltips with detailed information
